     Beethoven once said <q>Only the pure of heart can make a good soup</q>.Well,here's my attempt at doing just that!<br>

     <ol>
         <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 5 mins until soft. In a jug,make 750ml stock using the stock cube and boiling water.<br> Pour into the pan, add the sweet potato, carrots, peppers, stock and tomatoes, then season with pepper.Cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes
            </li>
         <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high. Toast the bread, then sprinkle the cheese on one side of each slice and grill until melted. Cut star shapes from each piece of toast using a cookie cutter, or cut star shapes with scissors. </li>
         <li>Blend the soup until smooth, add the coconut milk and season with black pepper. Stir well to combine, then ladle into bowls. Top with the cheesy stars and a twist of black pepper. </li>
         <li>Enjoy</li>
     </ol>
