     Beethoven once said <q>Only the pure of heart can make a good soup</q>.Well,here's my attempt at doing just that!<br>

     <ol>
         <li>Heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat and fry the onion for 5 mins until soft. In a jug,make 750ml stock using the stock cube and boiling water.<br>
             Pour into the pan, add the sweet potato, carrots, peppers, stock and tomatoes, then season with pepper.Cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes
            </li>
         <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high. Toast the bread, then sprinkle the cheese on one side of each slice and grill until melted. Cut star shapes from <br>
            each piece of toast using a cookie cutter, or cut star shapes with scissors. </li>
         <li>Blend the soup until smooth, add the coconut milk and season with black pepper. Stir well to combine, then ladle into bowls. Top with the cheesy stars and a twist of black pepper. </li>
         <li>Enjoy</li>

    Who can resist a salad ! Here's one of my Favorites.<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dressing 30 minutes ahead of time by combining the brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, vegetable oil and rice vinegar in a small jar with a tight fitting lid. Shake well.</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan over medium high heat with a few tablespoons of oil and break off bits of the noodles and fry them. They will puff up in the pan, so only add a few at a time. <br>
            As they begin to puff up, remove and drain them on kitchen roll.</li>
        <li>n a large bowl, combine the lettuce, chicken, spring onions and sesame seeds. Leave in the fridge to chill about 10 minutes. <br>
            Just before serving add the cooked rice noodles and toss with desired amount of dressing. Serve immediately in large bowls.</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
